# selfservice

This project was started because there were no viable alternatives found at the time that could provide password reset functionality at a reasonable price. At this point, it is a very old and rather ugly project, but I thought it might be useful to other sysadmins in a similar situation I was. 

## Basic Requirments
- Active Directory
- IIS
- .net 

## Note
As mentioned previously, this is a very old project. Please forgive the messiness, I needed to get something out there because otherwise the project was destined to languish in my backups for eternity. I'm very open to forks and PRs to try to clean this up.
